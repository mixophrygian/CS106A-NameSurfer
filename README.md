NameSurfer
==========

My solution to the NameSurfer assignment from the iTunes U course CS106A, Programming Methodology.  This version allows for user input in any case and displays results (if available) with standard first-letter-uppercase formatting.  If the results aren't available the Textfield is set to read (thatentry) + "is a fairly unpopular name".  The "Clear" button will remove all curretly displayed results as well as clear any text in the TextField.  And of course, this program is resizable!
